Quick Start
===========

This guide walks through the basic workflow for simulating night sky background
with nsb2.

Example Notebooks
-----------------

The best way to get started is with the example notebooks:

- **HESS-I Tutorial** — Complete walkthrough using the H.E.S.S. Phase I telescope
- **LST Tutorial** — Simulation setup for the CTAO Large-Sized Telescope
- **MST Tutorial** — Simulation setup for the CTAO Medium-Sized Telescope

These notebooks are available in the ``docs/examples/`` directory of the repository.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd docs/examples
   jupyter notebook HESSI_Tutorial.ipynb
