**Simulating Night Sky Background for Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes**

nsb2 is a Python library for calculating the effect of night sky background (NSB)
on telescopes with large pixel areas, namely imaging air Cherenkov telescopes
(IACTs). It includes models from theory and experimental data for star light,
zodiacal light, moon light and airglow.
